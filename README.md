# MapKit-inSwiftUI
Using CoreLocation(actively stalking the user wherever they go), a hint of Combine framework for back-end,
but most importantly, the main focus of this project is on MapKit. Integrated 2 maps; one shows user location and the other is as an MKPlaceMark

Lots of fun finding ETAs, distance between two points, checking for advisory notices, and doing reverse geocoding!
